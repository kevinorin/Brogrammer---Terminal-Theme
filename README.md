## Brogrammer Terminal Theme

Brogrammer is a theme/skin for your Mac OXS Command Line Terminal. The styles are based on the Sublime Text <a href="https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme" target="_blank">Brogrammer Theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kenwheeler">Ken Wheeler</a>.

## Motivation

I love the easy-on-the-eyes style guide of the Brogrammer theme and use it regularly in Sublime Text. It only made sense to apply the same styles to my Terminal.

## Installation

1. [Download and extract the .zip file](https://github.com/kevinorin/Brogrammer---Terminal-Theme/archive/master.zip)
2. Open Terminal App and navigate to `Terminal > Preferences`
3. Click the Settings dropdown and click `Import`. Navigate to the `brogrammer-terminal-theme.terminal` file you downloaded and click Open.

You're all set. You can click `Default` to use the Brogrammer theme everytime you run Terminal
